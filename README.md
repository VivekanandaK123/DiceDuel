# Dice Duel : Battle of Luck
**A fast-paced two-player dice game where strategy and luck decide the winner. First to reach 100 points wins — but beware the dice roll of 1!**
<br>
## 🎯 Objective
Be the first player to reach 100 points by rolling the dice and making smart decisions.
<br>
## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Player 1 starts the game.
2. On your turn, click 🎲 Roll Dice:
  - If you roll 2 to 6, that number is added to your Current Score.
  - If you roll a 1, you lose all your current points, and your turn ends. The other player now takes their turn.
3. You can choose to 📥 Hold at any time during your turn:
  - Your Current Score is added to your Total Score.
  - Your turn ends and passes to the other player.
4. Players keep taking turns until one player's Total Score reaches 100 or more.
5. Click 🔁 New Game at any time to reset scores and start over.

## ⚠️ Key Rules
- Rolling a 1 means you lose your current turn's points!
